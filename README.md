I decided to recreate Pong which is one of the earliest arcade video games.
Do you think your reflexes are faster than a computer? Why not test your skills out just to see who is faster! Get ready to go back to 1972 and beat the infamous AI paddle board.

Instructions:
Use the mouse to move up and down, making sure the ball doesn't go past the left side of the screen. If you miss a point goes to the computer.
Bounce the ball off certain parts of the paddle to make to the ball move in different directions, making it harder for the computer to catch the ball before passing the right side of the screen.

Goal:
Whoever makes 5 points wins.
